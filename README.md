## Features of the Project  
- üìä **Data Analysis Using SQL**: Querying customer data, transactions, and revenue metrics.  
- üíª **Dynamic Dashboards in Power BI**: Visualizing KPIs such as total revenue, profit margins, sales targets, and YoY comparisons.  
- üí° **Key Insights**: Identified revenue contributions, profit margin trends, and market-specific performance indicators.  
- üîç **Currency Normalization**: Standardized sales amounts to INR for accurate comparisons.  
- üìà **Target and Variance Analysis**: Compared actual performance against defined targets.

## Project Goals  
1. Analyze customer and transaction data to uncover meaningful insights.  
2. Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for visualizing sales trends and KPIs.  
3. Use DAX formulas for advanced calculations like profit margins, revenue contribution, and targets.

## **SQL Scripts Used**  

### 1. Show all customer records  
```sql
SELECT * FROM customers;
```

### 2. Show total number of customers  
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
```

### 3. Show transactions for Chennai market (Market Code: Mark001)  
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
```

### 4. Show distinct product codes sold in Chennai  
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT product_code FROM transactions WHERE market_code = 'Mark001';
```

### 5. Show transactions where currency is US Dollars  
```sql
SELECT * FROM transactions WHERE currency = 'USD';
```

### 6. Show transactions for the year 2020 (Join with Date Table)  
```sql
SELECT transactions.*, date.* 
FROM transactions 
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020;
```

### 7. Show total revenue in 2020  
```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
  AND (transactions.currency = 'INR\r' OR transactions.currency = 'USD\r');
```

### 8. Show total revenue in January 2020  
```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
  AND date.month_name = 'January' 
  AND (transactions.currency = 'INR\r' OR transactions.currency = 'USD\r');
```

### 9. Show total revenue in 2020 for Chennai  
```sql
SELECT SUM(transactions.sales_amount) 
FROM transactions 
INNER JOIN date ON transactions.order_date = date.date 
WHERE date.year = 2020 
  AND transactions.market_code = 'Mark001';
```

## **Power BI Formulas and Measures (DAX)**  

### 1. **Normalizing Sales Amounts to INR**  
```DAX
norm_amount = Table.AddColumn(#"Filtered Rows", "norm_amount", each if [currency] = "USD" or [currency] = "USD#(cr)" then [sales_amount]*75 else [sales_amount], type any)
```

### 2. **Total Revenue**  
```DAX
Revenue = SUM('Sales transactions'[norm_sales_amount])
```

### 3. **Profit Margin %**  
```DAX
Profit Margin % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],[Revenue],0)
```

### 4. **Profit Margin Contribution %**  
```DAX
Profit Margin Contribution % = DIVIDE([Total Profit Margin],CALCULATE([Total Profit Margin],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
```

### 5. **Total Profit Margin**  
```DAX
Total Profit Margin = SUM('Sales transactions'[Profit_Margin])
```

### 6. **Revenue Contribution %**  
```DAX
Revenue Contribution % = DIVIDE([Revenue],CALCULATE([Revenue],ALL('sales products'),ALL('sales customers'),ALL('sales markets')))
```

### 7. **Revenue for Last Year**  
```DAX
Revenue LY = CALCULATE([Revenue], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('sales date'[date]))
```

### 8. **Sales Quantity**  
```DAX
Sales Qty = SUM('sales transactions'[sales_qty])
```

### 9. **Profit Target**  
```DAX
Profit Target = GENERATESERIES(-0.05, 0.15, 0.01)
```

### 10. **Dynamic Target Value**  
```DAX
Profit Target Value = SELECTEDVALUE('Profit Target'[Profit Target])
```

### 11. **Target Difference**  
```DAX
Target Diff = [Profit Margin %] - 'Profit Target'[Profit Target Value]
```
